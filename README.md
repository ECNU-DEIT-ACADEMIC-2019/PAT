## 1. About PAT
Programming ability test, whose abbreviation is PAT, is a unified examination jointly sponsored and organized by National Higher Education Teaching and Research Center, iCourses Network, and the School of Computer Science and Technology of Zhejiang University. It aims to cultivate and demonstrate students' ability to analyze problems, solve problems and grade programming, scientifically evaluate computer programming talents, and provide reference standards for enterprises to select talents.

### 1.1. Company Alliance
PAT provides a standardized reference for corporate recruitment and selection of outstanding IT talent, and can reduce recruitment costs, which is welcomed by more and more corporate human resources departments and IT technology departments. Since August 2011, PAT has launched a “Company Alliance”, which promises to provide excellent candidates with information for companies within the Alliance. The company also promises not to disclose candidates' information, and to give priority to students with excellent PAT scores, and to waive the written test procedures related to the design process ability during recruitment. Alliance companies may propose special green channel conditions to PAT, and their specific conditions will be listed on the PAT registration website for candidates to view.

## 3.interaction
We will introduce from two aspects of instructional interaction and interface interaction.The instructional interaction of E-learning platform is defined as the method and process of information exchange among teaching elements supported by the network teaching environment, which mainly includes teacher-student interaction, student-student interaction and teacher-student and learning materials.

### 3.1.Instructional interaction
The instructional interaction of the PAT website we chose is mainly reflected in the discussion boards, courseware, quizzes and other sections of the supporting courses.The supporting courses of PAT platform are directly linked to the MOOC network of Chinese universities. The discussion section is divided into five sub-sections, namely, teacher answer section, classroom communication section, comprehensive discussion section, test assignment discussion section and programming software communication section.

#### 3.1.1.Teacher-student interaction
In the process of platform learning, teachers assume the roles of organizer, mentor and helper.。Immediate and effective interaction between teachers and students can correctly guide and supervise students to complete the learning process successfully. In PAT platform, the teacher-student interaction is mainly reflected in the teacher’answer area and classroom communication area.Students can post their doubts to the teacher's answer area and classroom communication area, and the teacher can give feedback and suggestions on students' questions at any time, so as to promote further learning.

#### 3.1.2.Student-student interaction
In the process of using the platform for learning, the interaction and collaboration between students can help eliminate the sense of loneliness and create a collective learning atmosphere.  PAT platform fully realizes the interaction between students and students, which is mainly reflected in the classroom communication area, comprehensive discussion area, test assignment discussion area and programming software communication area.Classroom communication area is mainly for learning content to ask, discuss,;Comprehensive discussion forum is not limited to courses, such as course certificate, language environment, etc.The discussion section of test assignments discusses and exchanges specific questions on specific tests.Programming software communication area is mainly for programming software communication.Each district has its own discussion topic to meet learners' personalized learning needs and enrich their learning experience, so as to master the knowledge more comprehensively and deeply.

#### 3.1.3.Resource interaction
Resource interaction means that teachers release learning contents and tasks through the platform, such as courseware, tests, reference materials, etc. Students complete the tasks through learning resources.It is reflected in the courseware, tests and assignments, textbooks and online reference materials of PAT platform.The resources provided by the supporting courses include video, lecture notes, literature, etc., which are available for students to download and save and facilitate students to expand their knowledge. In the PAT platform exercise module, there are C language program, data structure and other topic sets, which can help students systematically train their programming knowledge and skills.After entering the exercise module and submitting it, time consumption, scores and correct answers will be displayed.If you enter the submission list on the left, you can see the title submitted by the user, and click the serial number of the title to directly open the specific title.The ranking list on the left shows the ranking of all users.The exercises can help students to independently choose the question bank of the exercises, and have immediate feedback, as well as their own ranking in all users, which is conducive to positioning their learning level and enhancing their learning motivation.

#### 3.1.4.Summary
In general, the teaching interaction of PAT platform is relatively complete, including teacher-student interaction, student-student interaction and resource interaction.However, it is almost all reflected in the discussion board and exercise module, where appropriate interaction modes can be set in other sections. For example, a small assistant can be set to answer questions online at any time to answer any questions encountered by users in the process of using the platform, so as to enhance the intelligence and sense of belonging of the platform.

### 3.2.Interface interaction
The interactivity of PAT website is better overall, pay attention to user experience, easy to operate, easy for users to grasp.For example, when the mouse moves to an operational position, the system will give immediate feedback and perform the user's operation.Most operation pages can be returned to the main page by clicking the PAT logo in the upper left corner.
However, as the accompanying courses and exercises are directly linked to external websites, to return to the interface of PAT platform, one can only click back or re-enter, which needs to be improved.
